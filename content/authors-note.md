I started writing this book to teach people how to build websites. Over time, it became more than that. It became a way of pushing back—against complexity, against centralization, against surveillance, against the creeping sense that the web is no longer ours.

We live in a time of deep uncertainty, when even our essential needs often go unmet. Today's technology and the way we use it is a contradiction. It feels disposable and indispensable, superficial and profound, exploitive and empowering, convenient and constraining. We crave authenticity, but we got AI. We need truth, but we got TikTok. We want to create and connect—instead, we consume and coast.

Sometimes I wonder. *Are people using technology, or is technology using them?*

In times like these, using technology to learn, create, and contribute is a revolutionary act. What we make now—with our own hands, on our own terms—matters more than ever.

So I’m [giving this book away](https://github.com/mattcone/static-guide) under a Creative Commons license. Not because it has no value, but because the open web has never been more valuable, or more vulnerable.

If you’d like to support this project, you’ll be able to buy a professionally formatted ebook once the book is complete. But you don’t have to. The web version is free, and always will be.

If you find this work useful, share it. Remix it. Make it your own. But let it remind you that the web can still be a place of craft, simplicity, and freedom—where one person can make a difference.

Build your own path. And above all, stay human.

In solidarity,
